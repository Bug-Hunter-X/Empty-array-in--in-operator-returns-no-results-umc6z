# MongoDB Empty Array in $in Operator Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns no results, even if the field is allowed to be empty or contain an empty array. This is because `$in` is designed to match values explicitly present within the given array.

## Bug
The bug lies in the `find` query. When the array provided to the `$in` operator is empty, it will not match any documents, resulting in an empty result set. This behavior can be unexpected and can lead to incorrect results.

## Solution
To solve this issue, consider using the `$exists` operator to check if the field exists. If it does not need to exist, use the query as is. If the field is required to exist,  use the `$exists` operator in conjunction with a query targeting any other condition (depending on your requirement).  

## Additional notes
This is a common misconception and might go unnoticed during application development causing unexpected behavior.
